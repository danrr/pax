Things to try out:
==================
- Observation space is not the same for all agents
- blackbox policy - with layer in front?
- lower initial reward in iterated games with final set of games having higher games
- Give one agent the episode count
- Meta game aware agents but one with a delay (e.g. one has hidden state reset after one timestep)
- MuJoCo?
- Open AI hide and seek - https://openai.com/research/emergent-tool-use
